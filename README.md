## 🎨 UI/UX Design Rationale

### Emotional Logic Design
The app uses emoji-based mood selection because:
- **Universal**: Emojis transcend language barriers
- **Fast**: Quick visual selection beats text input
- **Emotional**: Symbols capture feelings better than words
- **Intuitive**: No learning curve for users

### UI Choices
1. **Emoji Grid (5x4)**: Shows all 20 options at once, reducing decision fatigue
2. **Color Coding**: Visual distinction (green=positive, red=negative) helps quick scanning
3. **Card Layout**: Provides visual hierarchy and breathing room
4. **Bottom Navigation**: Thumb-friendly, shows all main sections
5. **Material 3**: Modern design language with elevation and motion

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential features for expansion:
- Calendar view with mood indicators
- Chart visualization using fl_chart
- Export mood data as CSV
- Push notifications for daily reminders
- Mood tags/categories for better tracking
- Weekly/monthly mood summaries
- Multi-device sync improvements
- Social features (optional mood sharing)
